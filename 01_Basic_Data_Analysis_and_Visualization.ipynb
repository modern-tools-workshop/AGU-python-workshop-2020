    "Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "* General-purpose, cross-platform\n",
    "* Free and open source\n",
    "* Reasonably easy to learn\n",
    "* Expressive and succinct code, forces good style\n",
    "* Being interpreted and dynamically typed makes it great for data analysis\n",
    "* Robust ecosystem of scientific libraries, including powerful statistical and visualization packages\n",
    "* Large community of scientific users and large existing codebases\n",
    "* Major investment into Python ecosystem by Earth science research agencies, including NASA, NCAR, UK Met Office, and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. See Pangeo.\n",
    "* Reads Earth science data formats like HDF, NetCDF, GRIB\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "* Performance penalties for interpreted languages, although many libraries are wrappers for compiled languages. Avoid large loops in favor of matrix/vector operations when possible.\n",
